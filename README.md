# LeetCode Journal

This repository is dedicated to tracking my journey through LeetCode problems. Here, I aim to document my progress, share solutions, and reflect on my growth as a problem solver.

## Goals

1. Solve at least 1 problem a week.
2. **Practice coding without relying on external tools like AI or autocomplete.**
3. Improve in the following areas:
   - Problem-solving speed.
   - Optimizing solutions for time and space complexity.
   - Understanding algorithms and data structures better.
